One day you decide to enter a mysterious dungeon. Just twenty minutes adventure,
in and out. After your heroic self descends to the darkness and the passage habitually
collapses, leaving only the path forward, you suddenly remember something.
You forgot your backpack!
So, for this adventure you are backpackless. This means that you can carry
only one item you find in the dungeon, except the equipment you wear.

Good luck!
